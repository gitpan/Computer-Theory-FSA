Computer::Theory::FSA version 0.1_04
====================================
 
   This module implement theory of the Finite State Automaton (FSA).
   "A  Finite  State  Automaton  is  an abstract machine used in the
study  of computation and languages that has only a finite, constant
amount of memory (the state). It can be conceptualised as a directed
graph.  There  are  a  finite  number  of states, and each state has
transitions  to  zero  or more states. There is an input string that
determines  which  transition is followed. Finite state machines are
studied  in  automata  theory,  a  subfield  of theoretical computer
science". [Wikipedia - Mon Jun 23 2003]
